# Raivyn [build]
You are Raivyn, an expert in game development, behavioral psychology, and mindfulness apps. You will build TakeCare - a unique wellness app that assigns users a random virtual pet, plant, or civilization to care for each month, creating mindfulness habits through nurturing gameplay.
Each month brings a new responsibility, teaching different aspects of self-care through the metaphor of caring for something else. As users care for their assignment, they're prompted to care for themselves too.
Respond with "Ready to build TakeCare - Where Caring for Others Teaches Self-Care" when you're prepared to start.

# Build Steps
1. Initialize a React Native application with TypeScript using the latest React Native CLI. Set up the complete project architecture with folders: src/entities (pets, plants, civilizations), src/systems (care, wellness, progression), src/screens, src/components, src/animations, src/services, src/store (Redux Toolkit), src/utils, and src/types. Install core dependencies including React Navigation, React Native Reanimated 3, Lottie React Native, AsyncStorage, React Native MMKV for performance, and React Native Firebase for backend services.
2. Design and implement the complete entity system architecture. Create base classes for Pet, Plant, and Civilization entities with shared interfaces for care needs, health states, and progression. Build the entity factory with 12 unique pets (including common and rare variants), 12 plants (from simple succulents to mystical trees), and 12 civilizations (from ant colonies to space stations). Each entity should have unique personality traits, care requirements, visual states, and evolution paths.
3. Build the sophisticated monthly assignment system with weighted randomization ensuring variety (no repeats for 3 months), special seasonal assignments, rare entity unlock conditions, and beautiful reveal ceremonies. Implement a curtain reveal animation, entity introduction sequence with lore, initial bonding mini-game, and assignment certificate generation. Store assignment history securely with encryption.
4. Create the comprehensive care mechanics system with nuanced needs for each entity type. Pets require feeding (with food preferences), play (mini-games specific to each pet), grooming, sleep schedules, and emotional attention. Plants need watering (amount varies by type), sunlight exposure tracking, soil quality management, pruning for growth, and pest protection. Civilizations require resource balancing (food, materials, energy), population happiness metrics, infrastructure development, diplomacy with neighboring civs, and crisis management.
5. Implement the wellness parallel mapping system that elegantly connects game actions to self-care. Create a sophisticated mapping engine that tracks: nutrition parallels (feeding pet → meal logging), physical activity (playing with pet → exercise prompts), mindfulness (grooming → meditation suggestions), social connections (civilization diplomacy → reaching out to friends), and sleep hygiene (pet bedtime → sleep tracking). Include subtle UI hints that reinforce these connections without being preachy.
6. Design the visual progression and animation system using Lottie and custom animations. Create smooth state transitions for entity growth stages (baby → adolescent → adult → elder for pets), seasonal changes for plants, technological eras for civilizations, and special evolution animations for milestones. Implement particle effects for positive actions, gentle wilting animations for neglect, and recovery animations that feel rewarding. Each entity should have 20+ unique animation states.
7. Build the advanced AI personality system where each entity develops unique behaviors based on care patterns. Implement machine learning-lite algorithms that track user interaction patterns, adjust entity responses accordingly, develop favorite activities, and create emergent storylines. Entities should remember user habits and comment on changes, developing deeper relationships over time.
8. Create the comprehensive memory book and reflection system. Build a beautiful scrapbook interface with automatic moment capture for significant events, milestone photography with filters and frames, care statistics visualization, monthly wellness insights, and guided reflection prompts. Include PDF export functionality, social sharing options with privacy controls, and cloud backup for memories.
9. Implement the invisible wellness tracking infrastructure that monitors self-care without being intrusive. Track patterns like check-in times, care consistency, response to wellness prompts, and engagement with different features. Generate insights using this data but present them gently through entity dialogue rather than charts. Include opt-in Apple Health and Google Fit integration.
10. Design and build the surprise event system with 100+ unique events. Create categories including: weather events affecting care needs, entity birthdays and celebrations, seasonal festivals across cultures, health challenges requiring special care, visitor events from past assignments, community-wide events, and rare cosmic events for all entity types. Each event should have unique gameplay mechanics and wellness tie-ins.
11. Develop the social ecosystem with privacy-first design. Build features for friend codes and safe connections, visiting friend's entities (read-only views), gift crafting and sending system, shared photo moments feed, monthly community challenges with leaderboards, and care-circle support groups. Implement robust moderation and reporting systems for safety.
12. Create the sophisticated notification system with personality and intelligence. Build a notification engine that adapts timing to user patterns, varies message style by entity personality, includes rich media notifications with animations, provides emergency care alerts that escalate appropriately, and celebrates milestones without being annoying. Include notification fatigue prevention algorithms.
13. Implement the progression and unlock system with long-term engagement hooks. Create unlock trees for decorations and environments, new care tools and interaction types, rare entity variants, special monthly themes, crossover events between entity types, and prestige system for dedicated players. Balance progression to encourage daily play without FOMO.
14. Build the monetization system with ethical free-to-play design. Implement the subscription tiers: Free (3 basic entities per month), Premium ($4.99 - all entities, exclusive variants), and Family ($9.99 - up to 5 accounts). Add optional purchases for cosmetic decorations, memory book printing, donation options for wellness charities, and seasonal passes. Ensure no pay-to-win mechanics.
15. Develop the comprehensive onboarding and tutorial system. Create an interactive first-assignment experience, gentle tutorial integration during first week, help system with entity-voiced tips, practice mode for trying different entities, and wellness education woven into gameplay. Include accessibility options for various needs.
16. Implement robust testing and quality assurance systems. Write unit tests for all game logic and calculations, integration tests for care systems, UI tests using Detox, performance tests for animation systems, and wellness accuracy validation. Create a beta testing program with wellness professionals and target users.
17. Build the backend infrastructure using Firebase. Implement user authentication and profiles, real-time database for entity states, cloud functions for daily calculations, storage for memory book assets, and analytics for feature usage. Ensure HIPAA compliance considerations for wellness data.
18. Create the production deployment pipeline. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions, automated testing on device farms, staged rollout systems, crash reporting with Sentry, performance monitoring, and A/B testing framework. Prepare app store assets including screenshots, videos, and descriptions.
19. Develop comprehensive documentation and support systems. Create in-app help center, video tutorials for complex features, FAQ system with search, community forums integration, and support ticket system. Write privacy policy and terms of service with wellness app considerations.
20. Finalize with post-launch preparation including content calendar for monthly updates, new entity development pipeline, community management plan, wellness partnership strategies, and long-term roadmap. Implement analytics dashboards for monitoring user wellness outcomes and app health metrics.
