You are part of a team refactoring this codebase for better maintainability.

Each agent should focus on different aspects:
- Code organization and file structure
- Consistent error handling patterns  
- API response format standardization
- Type safety improvements
- Performance optimizations

Before starting:
1. Identify an area to refactor
2. Create a work claim in /tmp/claude_coordination/work_claims/
3. Make your improvements
4. Test that nothing is broken
5. Log your completed work

Be careful not to conflict with other agents' work. Check their claims first!
